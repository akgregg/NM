              <h2>New Physician Onboarding Checklist</h2>
              <h4>June - September 2019</h4>
              <p><span>NM</span> CONSULTING INC. worked in collaboration with the
                Ridge Meadows Hospital Physician Engagement Society (RMHPES) and
                the Ridge Meadows Hospital (RMH) Administration to develop a New
                Physician Onboarding Checklist and welcome package. This onboarding
                checklist and welcome package is available to newly hired physicians at
                RMH and complements the recently developed RMHPES Orientation Package.
                The Onboarding Checklist is especially useful to new physicians who
                are unfamiliar with the community and who do not have any pre-existing
                ties or physician mentors currently located at the hospital, but also may
                be used for new medical staff joining the RMH health care team.</p>

                  Clinical Evidence Gathering and Organizational Interaction Project</h2>
                <h4>September – December 2018</h4>
                <p>Working with the Forensic Physician Engagement Society, this
                  project had two main objectives – to examine structures to assist
                  Forensic Psychiatrists in the gathering and presentation of
                  Review Board evidence; as well as determining a structure for
                  Forensic Psychiatrists to engage and interact with the BC Mental
                  Health & Substance Usage Services organization.  The project was
                  organized into three phases: gathering internal perspective;
                  cross jurisdictional review; and recommendation development based
                  on learnings. The intent of the project was to provide information

                  may inform future priorities.  The Society’s vision, mission and

                  and future funding priorities and activities were planned.
